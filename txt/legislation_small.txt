Whereas on February 26, 2018, 18 State attorneys general and 2 Governors filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Texas v. United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.) (in this preamble referred to as Texas v. United States), arguing that the requirement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119) (in this preamble referred to as the ACA) to maintain minimum essential coverage is unconstitutional and, as a result, the court should invalidate the entire law;
Whereas in a June 7, 2018, letter to Congress, then Attorney General Jefferson Sessions announced that the Department of Justice—
would not defend the constitutionality of the minimum essential coverage provision; and
would argue that provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions (specifically the provisions commonly known as community rating and guaranteed issue) are inseverable from the minimum essential coverage provision and should be invalidated;
Whereas in the June 7, 2018, letter to Congress, Attorney General Sessions also advised Congress that the Department will continue to argue that Section 5000A(a) is severable from the remaining provisions of the ACA, indicating a difference from the plaintiffs’ position in Texas v. United States;
Whereas on December 14, 2018, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued an order that declared the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage unconstitutional and struck down the ACA in its entirety, including protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions;
Whereas the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas was stayed and is pending appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit;
Whereas on March 25, 2019, the Department of Justice, in a letter to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, changed its position and announced that the entire ruling of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas should be upheld and the entire ACA should be declared unconstitutional;
Whereas prior to 2014, individuals with pre-existing conditions were routinely denied health insurance coverage, subject to coverage exclusions, charged unaffordable premium rates, exposed to unaffordable out-of-pocket costs, and subject to lifetime and annual limits on health insurance coverage;
Whereas as many as 133 million nonelderly people in the United States—
have a pre-existing condition and could have been denied coverage, only offered coverage at an exorbitant price had they needed individual market health insurance prior to 2014, or had coverage for their pre-existing condition excluded prior to 2014; and
will lose protections for pre-existing conditions if the ruling of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas is upheld in Texas v. United States;
Whereas contrary to President Trump’s public claims that he supports protections for people with pre-existing conditions, he has ordered his Department of Justice to actively pursue the destruction of these protections in Federal court;
Whereas employer-provided health plans cannot place lifetime or annual limits on health coverage, and if the Trump Administration succeeds in its argument before the court, more than 100 million people in the United States who receive health insurance through their employer could once again face lifetime or annual coverage limits;
Whereas if the Trump Administration succeeds in its argument before the court, insurers would be allowed to impose an unlimited age tax on the health insurance premiums of older Americans;
Whereas prior to 2010, Medicare enrollees faced massive out-of-pocket prescription drug costs once they reached a certain threshold known as the Medicare donut hole, and since the donut hole began closing in 2010, millions of Medicare beneficiaries have saved billions of dollars on prescription drugs;
Whereas at a time when 3 in 10 adults report not taking prescribed medicines because of the cost, if the Trump Administration succeeds in its argument before the court, seniors enrolled in Medicare would face billions of dollars in new prescription drug costs;
Whereas as of March 2019, 37 States, including the District of Columbia, have expanded or are in the process of expanding Medicaid to individuals with incomes up to 138 percent of the Federal poverty level, providing health coverage to more than 12 million newly eligible people;
Whereas if the Trump Administration succeeds in its argument before the court, the millions of individuals and families who receive coverage from Medicaid could lose eligibility and no longer have access to health care;
Whereas as of March 2019, many people who buy individual health insurance are provided tax credits to reduce the cost of premiums and assistance to reduce out-of-pocket costs such as copays and deductibles, which has made individual health insurance coverage affordable for millions of people in the United States for the first time;
Whereas if the Trump Administration succeeds in its argument before the court, the health insurance individual exchanges would be eliminated and millions of people in the United States who buy health insurance on the individual marketplaces could lose coverage and would see premium expenses for individual health insurance increase exorbitantly;
Whereas if the Trump Administration succeeds in its argument before the court, people in the United States would lose numerous consumer protections in their coverage, including the requirements that—
plans offer preventive care without cost-sharing;
young adults have the option to remain on a parent’s insurance plan until age 26; and
many health insurance plans offer a comprehensive set of essential health benefits such as maternity care, addiction treatment, and prescription drug coverage;
Whereas pursuant to section 516 of title 28, United States Code, the conduct of litigation in which the United States is a party is reserved to the Department of Justice;
Whereas public reports suggest that the President and his political advisors directed this course of action in direct contravention of the Department of Justice’s longstanding policy to defend Acts of Congress and duty to advance reasonable analysis of legal questions, for example—
when the Department of Justice changed its litigating position on June 7, 2018, in the Texas v. United States case to ask the court to strike down the ACA’s guaranteed issue and community rating requirements, thereby eliminating protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reinstating legal discrimination based on health status, that position was found to be so legally indefensible that three of the four career attorneys representing the Government refused to sign the relevant briefs and removed themselves from the case; and
when the Department of Justice again changed its litigating position on March 25, 2019, in the appeal of Texas v. United States to seek the invalidation of every provision of the ACA, it was reported that decision was made over the objections of both the Department of Justice as well as the Department of Health and Human Services; and
Whereas the Trump Administration has proceeded in the Texas v. United States lawsuit with total disregard for the consequences of its actions for the lives of millions of Americans: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that—
the actions taken by the Trump Administration seeking the invalidation of the ACA’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and later the invalidation of the entire ACA, are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people; and
the Department of Justice should—
protect individuals with pre-existing conditions, seniors struggling with high prescription drug costs, and the millions of people in the United States who newly gained health insurance coverage since 2014;
cease any and all efforts to destroy Americans’ access to affordable health care; and
reverse its position in Texas v. United States, No. 19–10011 (5th Cir.).

That pursuant to clause 4, section 5, article I of the Constitution, during the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate or their respective designees, acting jointly after consultation with the Minority Leader of the House and the Minority Leader of the Senate, may notify the Members of the House and the Senate, respectively, to assemble at a place outside the District of Columbia if, in their opinion, the public interest shall warrant it.

Whereas chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code (commonly known as the Presidential Records Act of 1978), states that the records of the President and the President’s staff belong to the American people, not the President;
Whereas the Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires the President to document official activities and preserve all documentary materials produced or received by the President, the President’s staff, or units or individuals in the Executive Office of the President;
Whereas the Act defines the term documentary material as all books, correspondence, memoranda, documents, papers, pamphlets, works of art, models, pictures, photographs, plats, maps, films, and motion pictures, including, but not limited to, audio and visual records, or other electronic or mechanical recordations, whether in analog, digital, or any other form;
Whereas the Act was passed in response to President Nixon’s claim that he owned the tape recordings in his office, an assertion rejected by the Supreme Court; the Act consequently states that all files of the President must be preserved;
Whereas, according to numerous reports, President Trump has torn up or otherwise destroyed records;
Whereas President Trump reportedly seized the notes of an interpreter following a 2017 meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia; and
Whereas, consequently, senior Administration officials and Congress do not have knowledge of what President Trump told Mr. Putin: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that—
the President must preserve all records relating to the foreign meetings of the President in order to ensure that the advisors of the President, Congress, and the American people may have access to information regarding what transpired in those meetings, especially in meetings with adversaries of the United States; and
the term documentary material under the Presidential Records Act of 1978 includes notes taken during or documenting the content of presidential meetings with foreign leaders.

Whereas the Republic of the Marshall Islands—
is a sovereign country in free association with the United States under the Compact of Free Association between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (referred to in this preamble as the Compact), approved in the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–239; 99 Stat. 1770) and amended by the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (Public Law 108–188; 117 Stat. 2720), which authorizes economic assistance, through Federal grants and programs, to persons in the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and
has full authority and responsibility over security and defense matters relating to the Republic of the Marshall Islands;
Whereas, under the Compact, eligible citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands may reside, work, and study in the United States without a visa and may serve in the Armed Forces of the United States;
Whereas an estimated 1/3 of the population of the Republic of the Marshall Islands has relocated to the United States; and
Whereas Marshallese individuals who live in the United States—
offer positive economic and cultural benefits to the communities in which those individuals live;
pay Federal and State taxes but are not eligible for benefits under—
the Medicare program established under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); or
the Medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); and
were undercounted in the 2010 census and, as a result, areas where those individuals live are underserved by the Federal Government: Now, therefore, be it
That Congress—
commends—
the rich history and heritage of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and
citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who live in the United States for the contributions of those individuals to—
the communities in which those individuals live; and
the national defense of the United States through their service in the Armed Forces of the United States;
recognizes the strategic importance of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and
encourages a continued commitment to improve census data to better serve citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who live in the United States.

Whereas, on April 3, 1948, President Harry Truman signed into law the Economic Recovery Act of 1948, inspired by a plan of economic trade and assistance for European countries proposed by Secretary of State George C. Marshall, otherwise known as the Marshall Plan;
Whereas, from the years 1947 to 1951, the United States gave $13 billion, equivalent to approximately $143 billion in 2017 and less than one percent of United States gross domestic product (GDP) for nonmilitary foreign assistance programs for 2016, in economic aid and technical assistance to assist in the economic recovery of 16 European countries;
Whereas the Marshall Plan, among other objectives, sought to assure global peace and defend the national security of the United States through direct foreign assistance programs aimed at combating economic, social, and political degradation;
Whereas poverty, lack of opportunity, and environmental degradation are recognized as significant contributors to socioeconomic and political instability, as well as to the exacerbation of disease pandemics and other global health threats;
Whereas elevating the United States standing in the world represents a critical and essential element of any strategy to improve national and global security by mitigating the root causes of conflict and multinational terrorism, strengthening diplomatic and economic relationships, preventing global climate change, curbing weapons proliferation, and fostering peace and cooperation between all nations;
Whereas the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, signed into law on September 4, 1961, reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, [and] illness;
Whereas Congress created the Peace Corps in 1961 and the United States has since sent more than 230,000 volunteers to 141 nations to promote the Peace Corps’ mission of world peace and friendship through service in the developing world;
Whereas, on November 3, 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with the aim of providing direct support to developing countries in a manner free of political and military influence;
Whereas over the last 11 years, Congress and successive administrations have worked to more than double foreign assistance and implement a number of new foreign aid initiatives to support global health, development, human rights, and good governance, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), the President’s International Education Initiative, the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Food Security and Feed the Future Initiatives, and the Global Health Initiative;
Whereas the United States has pledged its support, along with every United Nations member state and numerous international organizations, to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in order to reduce extreme poverty, support sustainable development, and address the needs of the world’s most vulnerable populations;
Whereas the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, derived from the United Nations Millennium Declaration signed on September 8, 2000, seek to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development;
Whereas the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs indicates that in September 2015, major gaps still persisted in development aid monetary flows to the least developed countries and in eliminating trade barriers for developing countries;
Whereas, additionally, many people could not access essential medicines—generic medicines were available on average in 58 percent of public sector facilities—and only 32 per 100 citizens in developing countries had access to the Internet at affordable prices;
Whereas the World Bank estimates that in 2015, 767 million people across the globe were experiencing extreme poverty, living on less than $1.90 a day;
Whereas according to the United Nations Development Program’s 2016 Human Development Report more than 1.5 billion people (across 102 countries examined in the report) live in multidimensional poverty according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), an indicator which provides a comprehensive picture of severe deprivations common to poor households including in health, education, and standard of living;
Whereas the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2014 and increased to 821 million in 2017;
Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat has indicated that by 2050, the cost of adapting to global climate change in developing countries could amount to anywhere between $280 and $500 billion annually;
Whereas, in 2017, the United States was in 22nd place behind most industrialized nations in official development assistance funding as a percentage of gross national income (GNI), totaling $35.2 billion and representing 0.18 percent;
Whereas a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States, as codified in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives;
Whereas broad-based country- and community-ownership, sustainable and responsible trade opportunities, the robust engagement of vulnerable populations, including women, and a commitment to improve governance and the rule of law, are all critical to the long-term success of development programs;
Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United States continue to play a vital and increasing role in international efforts to create a more peaceful and prosperous world for all individuals through direct and indirect assistance;
Whereas studies indicate that 65 percent of the individuals in the United States, whose tax dollars fund Federal expenditures, support increasing funding to meet the Millennium Development Goals and to committing a higher percentage of GDP to address global poverty provided that other wealthy countries are willing to make the same commitment; and
Whereas a firm and significant financial commitment to enhance United States foreign assistance programs exemplifies the compassion and resolve of the people of the United States to benefit and empower all peoples of the world for the betterment of humankind: Now, therefore, be it
That Congress—
recognizes that foreign assistance programs are of critical importance in promoting national security, demonstrating the humanitarian spirit of the people of the United States, and improving the credibility and standing of the United States in world affairs; and
expresses its support for attaining the goal of providing, on an annual basis, an amount equal to no less than one percent of United States gross domestic product (GDP) for nonmilitary foreign assistance programs.

Whereas America’s fraternal benefit societies are long-standing mutual aid organizations created more than a century ago to serve the needs of communities and provide for the payment of life, health, accident, and other benefits to their members;
Whereas fraternal benefit societies represent a successful, modern-day model under which individuals come together with a common purpose to collectively provide charitable and other beneficial activities for broader society;
Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate under a chapter system—creating a nationwide infrastructure, combined with local energy and knowledge—positioning them to address most efficiently unmet needs in communities, many of which government cannot address;
Whereas the fraternal benefit society model represents one of the largest member-volunteer networks in the United States, with approximately 8 million Americans belonging to more than 25,000 local chapters across the country;
Whereas research has shown that the value of the work of fraternal benefit societies to society is more than $3.8 billion per year, accounting for charitable giving, educational programs, and volunteer activities, as well as important social capital that strengthens the fabric, safety, and quality of life in thousands of American local communities;
Whereas in 1909, Congress recognized the value of fraternal benefit societies and exempted such organizations from taxation, as later codified in section 501(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code;
Whereas fraternals have adapted since 1909 to better serve the evolving needs of their members and the public;
Whereas the efforts of fraternal benefit societies to help Americans save and be financially secure relieves pressures on government safety net programs; and
Whereas Congress recognizes that fraternal benefit societies have served their original purpose for over a century, helping countless individuals, families, and communities through their fraternal member activities: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that—
the fraternal benefit society model is a successful private sector economic and social support system that helps meet needs that would otherwise go unmet;
the provision for life, sick, accident, or other benefits to the members of these societies, as required by section 501(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, is necessary to support the charitable and fraternal activities of the volunteer chapters within their communities;
fraternal benefit societies have adapted since 1909 to better serve their members and the public; and
the section 501(c)(8) tax exemption of fraternal benefit societies continues to generate significant, outsized returns to United States society and the work of fraternals should continue to be promoted.

That in the enrollment of the bill S. 47, the Secretary of the Senate shall make the following corrections: 
Strike subsection (a) of section 1 and insert the following: (a) Short title.—This Act may be cited as the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act..
Strike the header of section 9003 and insert John S. McCain III 21st Century Conservation Service Corps Act (and conform the table of sections accordingly). 

Whereas in October of 2016, Hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti killing over 1,000 people, directly affected 2.1 million people including the internal displacement of 175,000 and 1.4 million people in need of urgent humanitarian aid;
Whereas the storm damage has been estimated to be $1,000,000,000, or about 11.4 percent of the gross domestic product of Haiti;
Whereas Hurricane Matthew was the worst hurricane to hit Haiti in over 50 years;
Whereas the Department of State warns United States citizens that current conditions make it unsafe to travel to southern Haiti due to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Matthew including roads made impassable by landslides, damaged roads, bridge failures and widespread damage to buildings and critical infrastructure;
Whereas the total value of crop losses is estimated to be $360 million;
Whereas approximately 45 percent of Haiti’s southwest piped water supply was damaged by Hurricane Matthew;
Whereas Haiti continues to struggle to address the devastating 2010 Cholera outbreak that has killed over 9,000 Haitians and infected almost 800,000 Haitians;
Whereas these conditions make it dangerous and inappropriate to forcibly repatriate Haitians at this time;
Whereas the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant temporary protective status (TPS) in accordance with section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) to nationals of a country in which environmental or political events have occurred that make it temporarily unsafe to deport them;
Whereas the Secretary of Homeland Security has granted TPS to nationals of other countries under similar conditions, including Nicaragua and Honduras in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch, and El Salvador in 2001 following severe earthquakes; and
Whereas granting Haitian nationals TPS would preserve the estimated $1,000,000,000 in remittances sent each year to Haiti from Haitians in the United States, which currently outweigh the amount of foreign assistance given by the United States to Haiti and are crucial to the recovery of Haiti: Now, therefore, be it
That the Congress—
supports the granting of temporary protected status to Haitian nationals currently residing in the United States;
supports the Haitian people and the Government of Haiti as they work to rebuild from years of natural disasters, economic hardship, and political turmoil; and
acknowledges that it is in the best economic and security interests of the United States for Haiti to be a safe, stable, and productive country.

Whereas, on May 21, 2009, the United States and the United Arab Emirates signed a bilateral agreement pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153), establishing cooperation on civilian nuclear programs in which the United Arab Emirates agreed that it shall not possess sensitive nuclear facilities within its territory or otherwise engage in activities within its territory for, or relating to, the enrichment or reprocessing of material, or for the alternation in form or content (except by irradiation or further irradiation or, if agreed by the Parties, post-irradiation examination) of plutonium, uranium 233, high enriched uranium, or irradiated source or special fissionable material;
Whereas the civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and the United Arab Emirates further obligates the United Arab Emirates to bring into force its Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement before the United States licenses exports of nuclear material, equipment, components, or technology pursuant to the agreement; and
Whereas this agreement became known as the first gold standard civil nuclear agreement and was lauded as a step toward establishing a precedent for strong nonproliferation standards on the Arabian Peninsula: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that any United States-Saudi Arabia civilian nuclear cooperation agreement under section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153), commonly known as a 123 Agreement, concluded in the future should prohibit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from enriching uranium or separating plutonium on Saudi Arabian territory in keeping with the strongest possible nonproliferation gold standard, as well as require the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to bring into force the Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Whereas every major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming country in the world maintains some form of direct or indirect subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or consumers;
Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that produce sugar maintain market-distorting subsidy programs, including—
the Government of Brazil which provides direct and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year for programs to promote its sugar and ethanol industry and has increased subsidies in recent years in the form of preferential loans, debt forgiveness, and increased ethanol usage mandates;
the Government of India which provides at least $1,700,000,000 per year in subsidy supports to prop up its inefficient sugar industry, including WTO-illegal export subsidies in 2014, 2015, and 2018;
the Government of Thailand which has more than tripled its sugar exports since 2004 by providing at least $1,300,000,000 in subsidies and government programs to its sugar industry and by maintaining domestic prices well above export prices;
the Government of the European Union which is sending an estimated $665,000,000 per year in subsidies to sugar farmers; and
the Government of Mexico which has used direct and indirect subsidies to keep open sugar mills owned by private industry and the government has sent direct payments to sugarcane growers, and has been found guilty of injuring United States sugar producers by dumping subsidized sugar into the United States market;
Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile commodity market in the world;
Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world today; and
Whereas if such a free market did exist, United States sugar farmers and processors could compete effectively in that market: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that—
the President should seek elimination of all direct and indirect subsidies benefiting the production or export of sugar by the government of—
each country that exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar in 2016, 2017, or 2018; and
by any other country with which the United States has in effect a free trade agreement;
if the President determines that all such subsidies by all such countries have been eliminated, the President should submit a report to Congress providing detailed information about how each of the countries has eliminated such subsidies; and
after submitting such a report, the President should propose to Congress legislation to implement United States sugar policy reforms.

The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the 38th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service (in this resolution referred to as the Memorial Service), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to honor the law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2018.
The Memorial Service shall be held on May 15, 2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate, with preparation for the event to begin on May 11, 2019, and takedown completed on May 16, 2019.
The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition (in this resolution referred to as the Exhibition), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to allow law enforcement representatives to exhibit their ability to demonstrate Honor Guard programs and provide for a bagpipe exhibition.
The Exhibition shall be held on May 14, 2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate.
Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be—
free of admission charge and open to the public; and
arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.
The sponsors of the Memorial Service and Exhibition shall assume full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the events.
Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsors referred to in section 3(b) are authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment, as may be required for the Memorial Service and Exhibition.
The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, in connection with the events.

Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, in the mid-fifth century B.C. under the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and the design of the sculptor Phidias;
Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the artistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek cultural heritage, including its art, architecture, and democracy, and of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers have made to civilization;
Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for ancient Greeks, Christians, and Muslims;
Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the United States in many preeminent public buildings, including the Lincoln Memorial;
Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon’s sculptures, now known as the Parthenon Marbles, were removed from the Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and 1816 by British nobleman Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, while Greece was still under Ottoman rule;
Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless storage there for many years, greatly endangered the Marbles;
Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to the British Museum only after severe personal economic misfortunes;
Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple, the carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are integral arts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all the Parthenon Marbles are reunified;
Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, democracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of concern not only to Greece but to all the world;
Whereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles;
Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical art;
Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be a gesture of good will on the part of the British Parliament, and would set no legal precedent, nor in any other way affect the ownership or disposition of other objects in museums in the United States or around the world;
Whereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon Marbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should be made whole;
Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Marbles equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, especially considering the irreparable harm caused by attempts by the museum to remove the original color and patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners;
Whereas Greece opened the New Acropolis Museum in 2009 which houses the Marbles that were not removed to the United Kingdom by Lord Elgin and displays them alongside plaster replicas of the Marbles currently in the British Museum so visitors can see the entire frieze as it was designed around the Temple of Athena;
Whereas it has been 200 years since the British Government voted to purchase the Marbles;
Whereas the Greek Government has publicly supported working with the British Government in a diplomatic manner to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the return of the Parthenon Marbles;
Whereas the people of Greece have a greater, ancient bond to the Parthenon Marbles, which were in Greece for over 2,200 years of the over 2,430-year history of the Parthenon; and
Whereas British Members of Parliament across the political spectrum have supported legislation to authorize the return of the Marbles to Greece: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of the Congress that the Government of the United Kingdom should enter into negotiations with the Government of Greece to facilitate return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece.

That in the enrollment of the bill S. 47, the Secretary of the Senate shall make the following corrections:

The event shall be held on June 15, 2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate.
Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be—
free of admission charge and open to the public; and
arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.
The sponsor shall assume full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the event.
Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsor is authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment as may be required for the event.
The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board are authorized to make such additional arrangements as may be required to carry out the event.
The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with respect to the event.

Whereas, on January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, that the goal of this campaign was to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, and that Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump;
Whereas, on March 20, 2017, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) testified that he was authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI is investigating whether there was any coordination between individuals associated with the Trump presidential campaign and the Russian Government;
Whereas part 600 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on March 7, 2019 (in this resolution referred to as Special Counsel Regulations), provides for the appointment of a Special Counsel when the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and—(a) That investigation * * * by a United States Attorney’s Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and (b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter;
Whereas the Special Counsel Regulations call for any individual named as Special Counsel to be a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decision making and with appropriate experience to ensure that both the investigation will be conducted ably, expeditiously and thoroughly, and that investigative and prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice policies;
Whereas, on May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General appointed former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as Special Counsel to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including an examination of any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation, and any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4(a);
Whereas the Acting Attorney General explained that he had appointed Special Counsel Mueller because he determined that it is in the public interest * * * to * * * appoint a Special Counsel to assume responsibility for this matter * * * based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires [him] to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command * * * [and that] a Special Counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome. Our nation is grounded on the rule of law, and the public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly;
Whereas Special Counsel Mueller has previously served in the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, United States Attorney, and Director of the FBI under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and his selection as the Special Counsel elicited bipartisan praise recognizing his reputation for competence, fairness, and nonpartisanship;
Whereas the Special Counsel’s investigation has thus far resulted in the public indictment of 34 individuals and 3 companies, 7 guilty pleas, and 1 conviction following a jury trial;
Whereas the Special Counsel Regulations provide that [a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel;
Whereas, on January 15, 2019, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Attorney General William Barr testified I * * * believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel’s work. For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law;
Whereas, on February 22, 2019, the chairs of six committees of the House of Representatives wrote to Attorney General Barr to inform him of their expectation that he will make Special Counsel Mueller’s report public to the maximum extent permitted by law;
Whereas transparency is consistent with the overall purpose and intent of the Special Counsel Regulations and the accompanying Department of Justice commentary, which notes the importance of ensur[ing] congressional and public confidence in the integrity of the process;
Whereas the need for transparency is most pronounced with regard to investigations that involve the President or individuals associated with his campaign as the President is responsible for the appointment of the senior leadership of the Department of Justice;
Whereas the Department of Justice’s United States Attorney’s Manual indicates that in public filings and proceedings, prosecutors should remain sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged third-parties, that is, of persons who the Department considers may be, but are not yet criminally charged;
Whereas this general nonstatutory policy of sensitivity to the interests of uncharged third-parties should be inapplicable to a sitting President because the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel has previously written that a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution;
Whereas the Department of Justice has on numerous recent occasions provided investigatory information to Congress and the public concerning investigations of high-level public officials in both pending and closed cases;
Whereas in the only other instance where a Special Counsel was appointed under the Special Counsel Regulations (in 1999, concerning the 1993 confrontation in Waco, Texas), both the interim and final reports, including findings, provided by the Special Counsel were released to the public by the Attorney General; and
Whereas the allegations at the center of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation strike at the core of our democracy, and there is an overwhelming public interest in releasing the Special Counsel’s report to ensure public confidence in both the process and the result of the investigation: Now, therefore, be it
That Congress—
calls for the public release of any report, including findings, Special Counsel Mueller provides to the Attorney General, except to the extent the public disclosure of any portion thereof is expressly prohibited by law; and
calls for the full release to Congress of any report, including findings, Special Counsel Mueller provides to the Attorney General.

The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association (in this resolution referred to as the sponsor) shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the event), on the Capitol Grounds.
The event shall be held on June 15, 2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate.
Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be—
free of admission charge and open to the public; and
arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.
The sponsor shall assume full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the event.
Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsor is authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment as may be required for the event.
The Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board are authorized to make such additional arrangements as may be required to carry out the event.
The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with respect to the event.

This resolution may be cited as the Reclaiming Congress’s Constitutional Mandate in Trade Resolution.
There is established a Joint Ad Hoc Committee on Trade Responsibilities (referred to as the Joint Ad Hoc Committee).
The Joint Ad Hoc Committee shall consist of 14 members, who shall be appointed not later than 60 days after the date of the adoption of this resolution, as follows:
Nine Members of the House of Representatives who shall be members of the Committee on Ways and Means or the Committee on Energy and Commerce, of whom—
six shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, one of whom (as designated by the Speaker at the time of appointment) shall serve as the Chair of the Joint Ad Hoc Committee; and
three shall be appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives.
Five Senators who shall be members of the Committee on Finance, of whom—
three shall be appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, one of whom (as designated by the majority leader at the time of appointment) shall serve as the Vice Chair of the Joint Ad Hoc Committee; and
two shall be appointed by the minority leader of the Senate.
The Joint Ad Hoc Committee shall develop a plan under which the functions and responsibilities of the Office of the United States Trade Representative shall be moved to the legislative branch in accordance with article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the United States.
In developing the plan under paragraph (1), the Joint Ad Hoc Committee shall consult regularly with the Congressional Advisory Board on Trade Responsibilities established under section 3.
Under the plan developed by the Joint Ad Hoc Committee under paragraph (1), the functions and responsibilities of the Office of the United States Trade Representative shall be moved to the legislative branch—
upon the expiration of the 4-year period which begins on the date the Joint Ad Hoc Committee submits the report described in subsection (e); or
on July 1, 2023,
The Joint Ad Hoc Committee may—
subject to subparagraph (B), sit and act at such places and times as the Joint Ad Hoc Committee determines are appropriate during the sessions, recesses, and adjourned periods of Congress; and
require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents, administer oaths, take testimony, and procure printing and binding.
Beginning on the date that is 90 days after the date of the adoption of this resolution, the Joint Ad Hoc Committee may meet at the call of the Chair or a majority of its members that are appointed as of such date.
That pursuant to clause 4, section 5, article I of the Constitution, during the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate or their respective designees, acting jointly after consultation with the Minority Leader of the House and the Minority Leader of the Senate, may notify the Members of the House and the Senate, respectively, to assemble at a place outside the District of Columbia if, in their opinion, the public interest shall warrant it.

Whereas chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code (commonly known as the Presidential Records Act of 1978), states that the records of the President and the President’s staff belong to the American people, not the President;
Whereas the Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires the President to document official activities and preserve all documentary materials produced or received by the President, the President’s staff, or units or individuals in the Executive Office of the President;
Whereas the Act defines the term documentary material as all books, correspondence, memoranda, documents, papers, pamphlets, works of art, models, pictures, photographs, plats, maps, films, and motion pictures, including, but not limited to, audio and visual records, or other electronic or mechanical recordations, whether in analog, digital, or any other form;
Whereas the Act was passed in response to President Nixon’s claim that he owned the tape recordings in his office, an assertion rejected by the Supreme Court; the Act consequently states that all files of the President must be preserved;
Whereas, according to numerous reports, President Trump has torn up or otherwise destroyed records;
Whereas President Trump reportedly seized the notes of an interpreter following a 2017 meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia; and
Whereas, consequently, senior Administration officials and Congress do not have knowledge of what President Trump told Mr. Putin: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that—
the President must preserve all records relating to the foreign meetings of the President in order to ensure that the advisors of the President, Congress, and the American people may have access to information regarding what transpired in those meetings, especially in meetings with adversaries of the United States; and
the term documentary material under the Presidential Records Act of 1978 includes notes taken during or documenting the content of presidential meetings with foreign leaders.

Whereas the Republic of the Marshall Islands—
is a sovereign country in free association with the United States under the Compact of Free Association between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (referred to in this preamble as the Compact), approved in the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–239; 99 Stat. 1770) and amended by the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (Public Law 108–188; 117 Stat. 2720), which authorizes economic assistance, through Federal grants and programs, to persons in the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and
has full authority and responsibility over security and defense matters relating to the Republic of the Marshall Islands;
Whereas, under the Compact, eligible citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands may reside, work, and study in the United States without a visa and may serve in the Armed Forces of the United States;
Whereas an estimated 1/3 of the population of the Republic of the Marshall Islands has relocated to the United States; and
Whereas Marshallese individuals who live in the United States—
offer positive economic and cultural benefits to the communities in which those individuals live;
pay Federal and State taxes but are not eligible for benefits under—
the Medicare program established under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.); or
the Medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.); and
were undercounted in the 2010 census and, as a result, areas where those individuals live are underserved by the Federal Government: Now, therefore, be it
That Congress—
commends—
the rich history and heritage of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and
citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who live in the United States for the contributions of those individuals to—
the communities in which those individuals live; and
the national defense of the United States through their service in the Armed Forces of the United States;
recognizes the strategic importance of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; and
encourages a continued commitment to improve census data to better serve citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands who live in the United States.

Whereas, on April 3, 1948, President Harry Truman signed into law the Economic Recovery Act of 1948, inspired by a plan of economic trade and assistance for European countries proposed by Secretary of State George C. Marshall, otherwise known as the Marshall Plan;
Whereas, from the years 1947 to 1951, the United States gave $13 billion, equivalent to approximately $143 billion in 2017 and less than one percent of United States gross domestic product (GDP) for nonmilitary foreign assistance programs for 2016, in economic aid and technical assistance to assist in the economic recovery of 16 European countries;
Whereas the Marshall Plan, among other objectives, sought to assure global peace and defend the national security of the United States through direct foreign assistance programs aimed at combating economic, social, and political degradation;
Whereas poverty, lack of opportunity, and environmental degradation are recognized as significant contributors to socioeconomic and political instability, as well as to the exacerbation of disease pandemics and other global health threats;
Whereas elevating the United States standing in the world represents a critical and essential element of any strategy to improve national and global security by mitigating the root causes of conflict and multinational terrorism, strengthening diplomatic and economic relationships, preventing global climate change, curbing weapons proliferation, and fostering peace and cooperation between all nations;
Whereas the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, signed into law on September 4, 1961, reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, [and] illness;
Whereas Congress created the Peace Corps in 1961 and the United States has since sent more than 230,000 volunteers to 141 nations to promote the Peace Corps’ mission of world peace and friendship through service in the developing world;
Whereas, on November 3, 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) with the aim of providing direct support to developing countries in a manner free of political and military influence;
Whereas over the last 11 years, Congress and successive administrations have worked to more than double foreign assistance and implement a number of new foreign aid initiatives to support global health, development, human rights, and good governance, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), the President’s International Education Initiative, the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Food Security and Feed the Future Initiatives, and the Global Health Initiative;
Whereas the United States has pledged its support, along with every United Nations member state and numerous international organizations, to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in order to reduce extreme poverty, support sustainable development, and address the needs of the world’s most vulnerable populations;
Whereas the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, derived from the United Nations Millennium Declaration signed on September 8, 2000, seek to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability, and develop a global partnership for development;
Whereas the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs indicates that in September 2015, major gaps still persisted in development aid monetary flows to the least developed countries and in eliminating trade barriers for developing countries;
Whereas, additionally, many people could not access essential medicines—generic medicines were available on average in 58 percent of public sector facilities—and only 32 per 100 citizens in developing countries had access to the Internet at affordable prices;
Whereas the World Bank estimates that in 2015, 767 million people across the globe were experiencing extreme poverty, living on less than $1.90 a day;
Whereas according to the United Nations Development Program’s 2016 Human Development Report more than 1.5 billion people (across 102 countries examined in the report) live in multidimensional poverty according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), an indicator which provides a comprehensive picture of severe deprivations common to poor households including in health, education, and standard of living;
Whereas the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2014 and increased to 821 million in 2017;
Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat has indicated that by 2050, the cost of adapting to global climate change in developing countries could amount to anywhere between $280 and $500 billion annually;
Whereas, in 2017, the United States was in 22nd place behind most industrialized nations in official development assistance funding as a percentage of gross national income (GNI), totaling $35.2 billion and representing 0.18 percent;
Whereas a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States, as codified in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives;
Whereas broad-based country- and community-ownership, sustainable and responsible trade opportunities, the robust engagement of vulnerable populations, including women, and a commitment to improve governance and the rule of law, are all critical to the long-term success of development programs;
Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United States continue to play a vital and increasing role in international efforts to create a more peaceful and prosperous world for all individuals through direct and indirect assistance;
Whereas studies indicate that 65 percent of the individuals in the United States, whose tax dollars fund Federal expenditures, support increasing funding to meet the Millennium Development Goals and to committing a higher percentage of GDP to address global poverty provided that other wealthy countries are willing to make the same commitment; and
Whereas a firm and significant financial commitment to enhance United States foreign assistance programs exemplifies the compassion and resolve of the people of the United States to benefit and empower all peoples of the world for the betterment of humankind: Now, therefore, be it
That Congress—
recognizes that foreign assistance programs are of critical importance in promoting national security, demonstrating the humanitarian spirit of the people of the United States, and improving the credibility and standing of the United States in world affairs; and
expresses its support for attaining the goal of providing, on an annual basis, an amount equal to no less than one percent of United States gross domestic product (GDP) for nonmilitary foreign assistance programs.

Whereas America’s fraternal benefit societies are long-standing mutual aid organizations created more than a century ago to serve the needs of communities and provide for the payment of life, health, accident, and other benefits to their members;
Whereas fraternal benefit societies represent a successful, modern-day model under which individuals come together with a common purpose to collectively provide charitable and other beneficial activities for broader society;
Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate under a chapter system—creating a nationwide infrastructure, combined with local energy and knowledge—positioning them to address most efficiently unmet needs in communities, many of which government cannot address;
Whereas the fraternal benefit society model represents one of the largest member-volunteer networks in the United States, with approximately 8 million Americans belonging to more than 25,000 local chapters across the country;
Whereas research has shown that the value of the work of fraternal benefit societies to society is more than $3.8 billion per year, accounting for charitable giving, educational programs, and volunteer activities, as well as important social capital that strengthens the fabric, safety, and quality of life in thousands of American local communities;
Whereas in 1909, Congress recognized the value of fraternal benefit societies and exempted such organizations from taxation, as later codified in section 501(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code;
Whereas fraternals have adapted since 1909 to better serve the evolving needs of their members and the public;
Whereas the efforts of fraternal benefit societies to help Americans save and be financially secure relieves pressures on government safety net programs; and
Whereas Congress recognizes that fraternal benefit societies have served their original purpose for over a century, helping countless individuals, families, and communities through their fraternal member activities: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that—
the fraternal benefit society model is a successful private sector economic and social support system that helps meet needs that would otherwise go unmet;
the provision for life, sick, accident, or other benefits to the members of these societies, as required by section 501(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, is necessary to support the charitable and fraternal activities of the volunteer chapters within their communities;
fraternal benefit societies have adapted since 1909 to better serve their members and the public; and
the section 501(c)(8) tax exemption of fraternal benefit societies continues to generate significant, outsized returns to United States society and the work of fraternals should continue to be promoted.

That in the enrollment of the bill S. 47, the Secretary of the Senate shall make the following corrections: 
Strike subsection (a) of section 1 and insert the following: (a) Short title.—This Act may be cited as the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act..
Strike the header of section 9003 and insert John S. McCain III 21st Century Conservation Service Corps Act (and conform the table of sections accordingly). 

Whereas in October of 2016, Hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti killing over 1,000 people, directly affected 2.1 million people including the internal displacement of 175,000 and 1.4 million people in need of urgent humanitarian aid;
Whereas the storm damage has been estimated to be $1,000,000,000, or about 11.4 percent of the gross domestic product of Haiti;
Whereas Hurricane Matthew was the worst hurricane to hit Haiti in over 50 years;
Whereas the Department of State warns United States citizens that current conditions make it unsafe to travel to southern Haiti due to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Matthew including roads made impassable by landslides, damaged roads, bridge failures and widespread damage to buildings and critical infrastructure;
Whereas the total value of crop losses is estimated to be $360 million;
Whereas approximately 45 percent of Haiti’s southwest piped water supply was damaged by Hurricane Matthew;
Whereas Haiti continues to struggle to address the devastating 2010 Cholera outbreak that has killed over 9,000 Haitians and infected almost 800,000 Haitians;
Whereas these conditions make it dangerous and inappropriate to forcibly repatriate Haitians at this time;
Whereas the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant temporary protective status (TPS) in accordance with section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) to nationals of a country in which environmental or political events have occurred that make it temporarily unsafe to deport them;
Whereas the Secretary of Homeland Security has granted TPS to nationals of other countries under similar conditions, including Nicaragua and Honduras in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch, and El Salvador in 2001 following severe earthquakes; and
Whereas granting Haitian nationals TPS would preserve the estimated $1,000,000,000 in remittances sent each year to Haiti from Haitians in the United States, which currently outweigh the amount of foreign assistance given by the United States to Haiti and are crucial to the recovery of Haiti: Now, therefore, be it
That the Congress—
supports the granting of temporary protected status to Haitian nationals currently residing in the United States;
supports the Haitian people and the Government of Haiti as they work to rebuild from years of natural disasters, economic hardship, and political turmoil; and
acknowledges that it is in the best economic and security interests of the United States for Haiti to be a safe, stable, and productive country.

Whereas, on May 21, 2009, the United States and the United Arab Emirates signed a bilateral agreement pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153), establishing cooperation on civilian nuclear programs in which the United Arab Emirates agreed that it shall not possess sensitive nuclear facilities within its territory or otherwise engage in activities within its territory for, or relating to, the enrichment or reprocessing of material, or for the alternation in form or content (except by irradiation or further irradiation or, if agreed by the Parties, post-irradiation examination) of plutonium, uranium 233, high enriched uranium, or irradiated source or special fissionable material;
Whereas the civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and the United Arab Emirates further obligates the United Arab Emirates to bring into force its Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement before the United States licenses exports of nuclear material, equipment, components, or technology pursuant to the agreement; and
Whereas this agreement became known as the first gold standard civil nuclear agreement and was lauded as a step toward establishing a precedent for strong nonproliferation standards on the Arabian Peninsula: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that any United States-Saudi Arabia civilian nuclear cooperation agreement under section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153), commonly known as a 123 Agreement, concluded in the future should prohibit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from enriching uranium or separating plutonium on Saudi Arabian territory in keeping with the strongest possible nonproliferation gold standard, as well as require the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to bring into force the Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Whereas every major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming country in the world maintains some form of direct or indirect subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or consumers;
Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that produce sugar maintain market-distorting subsidy programs, including—
the Government of Brazil which provides direct and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year for programs to promote its sugar and ethanol industry and has increased subsidies in recent years in the form of preferential loans, debt forgiveness, and increased ethanol usage mandates;
the Government of India which provides at least $1,700,000,000 per year in subsidy supports to prop up its inefficient sugar industry, including WTO-illegal export subsidies in 2014, 2015, and 2018;
the Government of Thailand which has more than tripled its sugar exports since 2004 by providing at least $1,300,000,000 in subsidies and government programs to its sugar industry and by maintaining domestic prices well above export prices;
the Government of the European Union which is sending an estimated $665,000,000 per year in subsidies to sugar farmers; and
the Government of Mexico which has used direct and indirect subsidies to keep open sugar mills owned by private industry and the government has sent direct payments to sugarcane growers, and has been found guilty of injuring United States sugar producers by dumping subsidized sugar into the United States market;
Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile commodity market in the world;
Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world today; and
Whereas if such a free market did exist, United States sugar farmers and processors could compete effectively in that market: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of Congress that—
the President should seek elimination of all direct and indirect subsidies benefiting the production or export of sugar by the government of—
each country that exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar in 2016, 2017, or 2018; and
by any other country with which the United States has in effect a free trade agreement;
if the President determines that all such subsidies by all such countries have been eliminated, the President should submit a report to Congress providing detailed information about how each of the countries has eliminated such subsidies; and
after submitting such a report, the President should propose to Congress legislation to implement United States sugar policy reforms.

The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the 38th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service (in this resolution referred to as the Memorial Service), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to honor the law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2018.
The Memorial Service shall be held on May 15, 2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate, with preparation for the event to begin on May 11, 2019, and takedown completed on May 16, 2019.
The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition (in this resolution referred to as the Exhibition), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to allow law enforcement representatives to exhibit their ability to demonstrate Honor Guard programs and provide for a bagpipe exhibition.
The Exhibition shall be held on May 14, 2019, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate.
Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be—
free of admission charge and open to the public; and
arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.
The sponsors of the Memorial Service and Exhibition shall assume full responsibility for all expenses and liabilities incident to all activities associated with the events.
Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsors referred to in section 3(b) are authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment, as may be required for the Memorial Service and Exhibition.
The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, in connection with the events.

Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, in the mid-fifth century B.C. under the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and the design of the sculptor Phidias;
Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the artistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek cultural heritage, including its art, architecture, and democracy, and of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers have made to civilization;
Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for ancient Greeks, Christians, and Muslims;
Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the United States in many preeminent public buildings, including the Lincoln Memorial;
Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon’s sculptures, now known as the Parthenon Marbles, were removed from the Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and 1816 by British nobleman Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, while Greece was still under Ottoman rule;
Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless storage there for many years, greatly endangered the Marbles;
Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to the British Museum only after severe personal economic misfortunes;
Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple, the carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are integral arts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all the Parthenon Marbles are reunified;
Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, democracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of concern not only to Greece but to all the world;
Whereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles;
Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical art;
Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be a gesture of good will on the part of the British Parliament, and would set no legal precedent, nor in any other way affect the ownership or disposition of other objects in museums in the United States or around the world;
Whereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon Marbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should be made whole;
Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Marbles equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, especially considering the irreparable harm caused by attempts by the museum to remove the original color and patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners;
Whereas Greece opened the New Acropolis Museum in 2009 which houses the Marbles that were not removed to the United Kingdom by Lord Elgin and displays them alongside plaster replicas of the Marbles currently in the British Museum so visitors can see the entire frieze as it was designed around the Temple of Athena;
Whereas it has been 200 years since the British Government voted to purchase the Marbles;
Whereas the Greek Government has publicly supported working with the British Government in a diplomatic manner to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the return of the Parthenon Marbles;
Whereas the people of Greece have a greater, ancient bond to the Parthenon Marbles, which were in Greece for over 2,200 years of the over 2,430-year history of the Parthenon; and
Whereas British Members of Parliament across the political spectrum have supported legislation to authorize the return of the Marbles to Greece: Now, therefore, be it
That it is the sense of the Congress that the Government of the United Kingdom should enter into negotiations with the Government of Greece to facilitate return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece.

arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.

Whereas, on January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election, that the goal of this campaign was to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, and that Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump;
Whereas, on March 20, 2017, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) testified that he was authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI is investigating whether there was any coordination between individuals associated with the Trump presidential campaign and the Russian Government;
Whereas part 600 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on March 7, 2019 (in this resolution referred to as Special Counsel Regulations), provides for the appointment of a Special Counsel when the Attorney General or Acting Attorney General determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and—(a) That investigation * * * by a United States Attorney’s Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and (b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter;
Whereas the Special Counsel Regulations call for any individual named as Special Counsel to be a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decision making and with appropriate experience to ensure that both the investigation will be conducted ably, expeditiously and thoroughly, and that investigative and prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice policies;
Whereas, on May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General appointed former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as Special Counsel to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including an examination of any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation, and any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4(a);
Whereas the Acting Attorney General explained that he had appointed Special Counsel Mueller because he determined that it is in the public interest * * * to * * * appoint a Special Counsel to assume responsibility for this matter * * * based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires [him] to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command * * * [and that] a Special Counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome. Our nation is grounded on the rule of law, and the public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly;
Whereas Special Counsel Mueller has previously served in the Department of Justice as a prosecutor, United States Attorney, and Director of the FBI under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and his selection as the Special Counsel elicited bipartisan praise recognizing his reputation for competence, fairness, and nonpartisanship;
Whereas the Special Counsel’s investigation has thus far resulted in the public indictment of 34 individuals and 3 companies, 7 guilty pleas, and 1 conviction following a jury trial;
Whereas the Special Counsel Regulations provide that [a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel;
Whereas, on January 15, 2019, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Attorney General William Barr testified I * * * believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel’s work. For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law;
Whereas, on February 22, 2019, the chairs of six committees of the House of Representatives wrote to Attorney General Barr to inform him of their expectation that he will make Special Counsel Mueller’s report public to the maximum extent permitted by law;
Whereas transparency is consistent with the overall purpose and intent of the Special Counsel Regulations and the accompanying Department of Justice commentary, which notes the importance of ensur[ing] congressional and public confidence in the integrity of the process;
Whereas the need for transparency is most pronounced with regard to investigations that involve the President or individuals associated with his campaign as the President is responsible for the appointment of the senior leadership of the Department of Justice;
Whereas the Department of Justice’s United States Attorney’s Manual indicates that in public filings and proceedings, prosecutors should remain sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged third-parties, that is, of persons who the Department considers may be, but are not yet criminally charged;
Whereas this general nonstatutory policy of sensitivity to the interests of uncharged third-parties should be inapplicable to a sitting President because the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel has previously written that a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution;
Whereas the Department of Justice has on numerous recent occasions provided investigatory information to Congress and the public concerning investigations of high-level public officials in both pending and closed cases;
Whereas in the only other instance where a Special Counsel was appointed under the Special Counsel Regulations (in 1999, concerning the 1993 confrontation in Waco, Texas), both the interim and final reports, including findings, provided by the Special Counsel were released to the public by the Attorney General; and
Whereas the allegations at the center of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation strike at the core of our democracy, and there is an overwhelming public interest in releasing the Special Counsel’s report to ensure public confidence in both the process and the result of the investigation: Now, therefore, be it
That Congress—
calls for the public release of any report, including findings, Special Counsel Mueller provides to the Attorney General, except to the extent the public disclosure of any portion thereof is expressly prohibited by law; and
calls for the full release to Congress of any report, including findings, Special Counsel Mueller provides to the Attorney General.
